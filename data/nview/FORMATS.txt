.. This document is in reStructuredText format.

This document describes the data format in the pinpoint data/nview
directory. These formats are compatible with the `Multi Camera Self
Calibration Toolbox`_ by Svoboda et al.

Each sub-directory contains a self-contained dataset from an
individual camera setup. The file extension .dat indicates a file
containing a single, ASCII text formatted 2 dimensional array.

Files
-----
Res.dat : camera resolution (.dat file)
    This file holds an Nx2 array with width and height of N cameras.
IdMat.dat : point visibility (.dat file)
    This file holds an NxM array of booleans describing the visibility
    of M points in N cameras.
points.dat : image coordinates (.dat file)
    This file holds an (N*3)xM array containing the raw (distorted)
    camera coordinates of M points.
basename*.rad : radial distortion parameters
    This file is valid as both a Python and MATLAB(R) script, and
    contains radial distortion parameters compatible with the `Caltech
    Camera Calibration Toolbox`_ and the `Multi Camera Self
    Calibration Toolbox`_.
camera_order.txt : ordered list of camera names
    Contains a "common name" for each of N cameras. This file is
    specific to the pinpoint toolbox.
postion_guess.dat : estimates of camera positions
    Contains (potentially very rough) estimates of camera
    positions. This is used to find the homography between the output
    of the calibration routines and the actual world coordinate system
    in use. This file is specific to the pinpoint toolbox, but the
    same data go in a file in
    MultiCamSelfCal/MultiCamSelfCal/BlueCLocal/ in the `Multi Camera
    Self Calibration Toolbox`_.
description.txt : optional description of the origin of the data
    This is a strictly optional text file describing the origin of the
    data.
