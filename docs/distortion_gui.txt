A distortion-estimation GUI.

The program is run from the command line after installing the pinpoint
package by running "pinpoint_distortion_gui filename.jpg".

Implemented Features
--------------------

 * Simultaneously view multiple images sharing the same distortion model

 * Manually adjust distortion model and watch live updates of
   undistorted image

 * Automatically estimate distortion using manually entered straight
   lines. (Uses the algorithm of 'Line-Based Correction of Radial Lens
   Distortion' (GMIP 1997) by Prescott and McLean)

Planned and wished-for features
--------------------------------

 * Unit tests of distortion (forward and reverse) functionality.

 * Automatically detected checkerboard corners so that distortion
   estimation is fully automated.

 * Distortion visualization

 * An "add image" button - currently this must be done through the
   command line at program invocation.

 * Alternative distortion models

 * A view of the lines that have been manually or automatically
   entered on the image so that individual lines or vertices can be
   removed or added. (Currently, there are a couple hotkeys in the
   image canvas for implementing this.)

Known Bugs
----------

 * Images are shown in an expandable panel which is initially
   collapsed. To un-collapse the panel, click along the top few pixels
   of the main screen portion.

Thanks to St√©fan for providing a demonstration of how to use
scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates() for fast image warping. Also, this was
my first endeavor using enthought.traits, which is a really powerful
toolkit.
